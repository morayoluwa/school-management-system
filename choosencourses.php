 <!-- in this pae i want to see the courses picked by student here and i also want to have edit and delete button here 
 in case student want to pick another course or delete all former choosen courses

 in this case if student wants to pick another course, then it will redirect the student back to the choosecourse.php  -->

 <!-- for me to see the courses have choosen here, i will need to use join in this page bcos the courses are been inserted as 
 numbers i.e 1,2,3(integers)
i will then need to use join to bring out the name of the courses in this page... and this page 
is the one that will be displayed to the lecturer to grade the students  -->
